													FridgeMate is a PoC consumer product that aims to empower consumers with a convenient way of tracking their fridge inventory. 
													As a team of 7, we were able to build an end-to-end consumer product that incorporates an installable hardware device paired with
													mobile app. This product allows user to add/remove items to their fridge's inventory in real-time and be able to track their 
													inventory wherever they are. The hardware device consists of 2 STM32 SoC boards, an ESP32 WIFI chip, a pressure sensor, a temperature/humidity sensor,
													a camera, and a barcode scanner. Users are able to scan fridge items as they are placed into the fridge. All data is stored in the cloud
													using RDS MySQL (item data), AWS S3 (item images), and AWS Amplify (account information). Users are able to access their specific fridge's data by
													logging into the FridgeMate mobile app. The app was developed using React Native and can be viewed on either Android or Apple devices.
